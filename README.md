# BeSafe

The idea revolves around three central features : The Assistant, V-Scale(Vulnerability scale) & Q-Bot(Query/Questionnaire bot)

The Assistant: Assistant works in two modes: Setup Mode, Assist Mode    

Setup Mode: It is basically pre disaster setup to handle scenarios when the disaster occurs. In it we will have several       
functionalities as mentioned: one functionality is that user would be able to set contacts of some close relatives to be notified of their location and wellness status at the time of disaster, also he will be granting several permissions to activities to be undertaken automatically when triggered by a homescreen button at the time of disaster. Activities such as setting cellphone in power saver mode, sending SOS, Location acessibility. In setup mode a checklist of current status of disaster handling kit would also be there.

Assist Mode: This mode comes into action as soon as the user presses the button on his homescreen. This in turn triggers the pre set commands in the setup mode and launches an interface with several activities on the screen presenting the user with various options such as : siren button, rescue operation feed, map(rescue outreach, vulnerability plot depicting safe and affected routes/regions), local help forum, Q-bot(as a Query Bot).
